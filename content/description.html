            <h1>Dynamic structure</h1>
            <p>The dynamic structure means that the entire form is assembled like lego cubes - from buttons. These buttons are customized at your discretion.</p>
            <p>To customize the buttons, you have keys that you insert into the text of your button from a script or plugin. This allows you to achieve maximum freedom, and most importantly, an unlimited number of variations of your forms.</p>

            <p>GrimUI is filled with the most incredible technologies, some of which do not exist in any UI! These technologies are related not only to design, but also to optimization.</p>
            <p>• Soft padding centralization</p>
            <p>• Text buffer fill-based paddings</p>
            <p>• Advanced vertical processing</p>
            <p>And so much more!</p>

            <h1>Fullstack & Ready-to-go UI</h1>
            <p>GrimUI has already been prepared and configured for release to your server. You just need to assemble your forms! GrimUI has both a long form and a custom form, which allows you to fully immerse yourself in the Ore-UI style.</p>
            <p>GrimUI will work on any device, adapting to the user's screen and its proportions.</p>
            <p>If you have difficulty creating your own forms, which is quite simple, then you can always take ready-made templates.</p>
