            <h2>What exactly dynamic is?</h2>
            As I said before, the dynamic structure of a form is one where there is only one form that you customize as you want using buttons. Buttons are customized using keys, it's like their property. A dynamic structure is always more difficult to develop and optimize. But in the end, you get the opportunity to create an unlimited number of variations of your form directly from the plugin or script.</div>

            No. GrimUI is a private pack, but you have the option to purchase it.</div>

        <div class="dropdown-content">
            <h2>How can I customize the styles of the UI itself?</h2>
            GrimUI has a separate file weighing 14 kilobytes, which contains all the elements of style, texture, text, and so on. You can change all these elements or their textures without damaging the work of GrimUI itself.</div>

        </button>
        <div class="dropdown-content">
            <h2>What happens if the UI is downloaded from my server?</h2>
            GrimUI is designed so that all the keys are scattered by code, and I remind you that GrimUI weight is 234 kilobytes. Since GrimUI is a dynamic form, you need to build it yourself using keys, and finding keys in the code is quite difficult. Therefore, all keys are provided in a separate file, which it is recommended not to declassify. With GrimUI, you can also request obfuscation, which will help protect your resource pack.</div>

        </button>
        <div class="dropdown-content">
            <h2>What i will get with GrimUI?</h2>
            When purchasing GrimUI, you are provided with unlimited support for using GrimUI, a text file with all the keys, the ability to request obfuscation, as well as combining GrimUI with your current resource pack. You can also request help in building your own forms, since the same dynamic layout is quite complicated without understanding its principle of operation.</div>

            GrimUI is designed as a large and complex UI pack for large servers, where there is a lot of user interface. Just for this solution, GrimUI uses a dynamic structure so that you can create different UI forms without letting the user get bored.</div>
